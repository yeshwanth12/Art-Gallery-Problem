# Art-Gallery-Tool
# Introduction
This is a Pedagogical tool for solving the Art Gallery problem using Triangulation and 3-coloring.
The Art gallery problem is the problem of determining the minimum number of guards required to guard an Art gallery room.
The room is a simple polygon (polygon with no holes and no crossings), and the guards are a set of points inside, on the edges or on the vertices of the polygon.<br>
Finding the exact number of point guards required to guard the entire room is an NP-Hard problem.<br>
Steve Fisk claims that to guard a simple polygonal room with n vertices, you never need more than floor(n/3) vertex guards.
In this tool, we find the sufficient number of vertex guards (points placed on the vertices of the polygon) required to guard the polygonal room with n vertices in O(n log n) time using Fisk’s proof.

# Implementation

* Ear Clipping Algorithm for Triangulation [1]
* M-coloring using backtracking for 3-coloring [2]
* Polygon Visibility

# Polygon Visibility from Vertex Algorithm
```
Given a simple polygon and a vertex
Maintain a list for storing invisible_edges = []
For every other vertex V:
	if V is visible:
    	if no invisible edges between previous visible vertex and V:
        	Add V to solution
        else:
        	Find the closest intersection point of the invisible edges
            with line[vertex, previous visible V] and line[vertex, V]
            from the vertex such that the V or previous visible V is
            on the segment[vertex, intersection]
            
            if the 2 edges that meet at previous visible V are on
            same sides of line[vertex, previous visible V]:
            	if the line from closest intersection point for 
                line[vertex, previous visible V] to previous visible V
                is in polygon:
                	Add closest intersection point to solution
             
            if the 2 edges that meet at previous visible V are on
            same sides of line[vertex, V]:
            	if the line from closest intersection point for 
                line[vertex, V] to V
                is in polygon:
                	Add closest intersection point to solution
            
            Add V to solution
    else if V is not visible:
    	add V to invisible_edges
```
    	
# Issues
* Polygon Visibility is inaccurate in rare cases because of floating point comparisons (issues with precission).
* Triangulation may fail sometimes if the points are placed too close to each other (bug in the ear clipping algorithm).
* Does not always give minimum no. of guards (flaw in the approach, finding accurate answer always is NP-hard problem).

# Future Work
* Efficient Vertex guard visibility algorithm
* Editing polygon during run time (by drag and drop of edges and vertices)
* Ability to pause the visualization of the algorithm
* More appealing visual effects
